# Intelligence Task Ontology and Knowledge Graph (ITO) / AI ontology
## A comprehensive knowledge graph of artificial intelligence tasks and benchmarks
The Intelligence Task Ontology and Knowledge Graph (ITO) provides comprehensive, curated and interlinked data of artificial intelligence tasks, benchmarks, AI performance metrics, benchmark results and research papers.

You can [browse ITO online at BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ITO/?p=classes&conceptid=https%3A%2F%2Fidentifiers.org%2Fito%3AITO_00141).

### Examples
ITO aims to provide a richly structured hierarchy of processes, algorithms, data and performance metrics. Data on thousands of AI benchmark results have been imported from [Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/) and are further curated.

An example of a benchmark result embedded in an ontological hierarchy:

### Using ITO

ITO is made available as an OWL (Web Ontology Language) file. You can use the [Protege ontology editor](https://protege.stanford.edu/) to explore and edit the resource. You can use a wide variety of frameworks for OWL, RDF and the SPARQL graph query language to access and query the ontology. We recommend using the [Blazegraph](https://blazegraph.com/) triple store. 

Example: [Google Colab notebook demonstrating SPARQL queries with ITO](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1g3gDgakBcmAfIi4opXX99KXB7yALK66S?usp=sharing).
