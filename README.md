# Introducing the Intelligence Task Ontology (ITO)-- an Artificial Intelligence Ontology

The Intelligence Task Ontology (ITO) provides a comprehensive map of artificial intelligence tasks, as well as broader human intelligence or hybrid human/machine intelligence tasks.

You can [browse ITO online at BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ITO/?p=classes&conceptid=https%3A%2F%2Fai-strategies.org%2Fontology%2FProcess).

### Examples
ITO aims to provide a richly structured hierarchy of processes, algorithms, data and performance metrics. Data on thousands of AI benchmark results have been imported from [Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/) and are further curated.

An example of a benchmark result embedded in an ontological hierarchy:
