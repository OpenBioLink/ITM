# Analysis of performance metrics used for measuring progress in artificial intelligence

This folder contains resources created as part of the paper 'A critical analysis of metrics used for measuring progress in artificial intelligence' (under review). 
A pre-print of the paper has been published on arXiv: [Pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02577)

## Resources

### Notebooks

The Jupyter notebook ['ITO metrics - queries and statistics'](https://github.com/OpenBioLink/ITO/blob/master/notebooks/performance_metrics_analysis/ITO%20metrics%20-%20queries%20and%20statistics.ipynb) contains
the SPARQL queries to generate statistics on performance metrics based on ITO and the Python code for analysing the raw data.

### Additional files

The folder ['data']((https://github.com/OpenBioLink/ITO/blob/master/notebooks/performance_metrics_analysis/data)) contains:
* CSV files with complete statistics for all performance metric analyses included in the Jupyter notebook.
* A [mapping](https://github.com/OpenBioLink/ITO/blob/master/notebooks/performance_metrics_analysis/data/overview_of_metrics_alternative_namings) of commonly used naming variants of the most frequently used performance metrics.
* An overview of the basic properties of the top 50 most frequently used performance metrics.
